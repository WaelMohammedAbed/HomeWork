The goal of the Composite pattern is to make the leaf objects more or less indistinguishable from the composite objects.
You will know that you need to use the Composite pattern when you are trying to build a hierarchy or tree of objects,
 and you do not want the code that uses the tree to constantly have to worry about whether it is dealing with a single
 object or a whole bushy branch of the tree.
